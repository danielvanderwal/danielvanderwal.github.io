## Using grep and Regular Expressions

grep = designed for finding matching patterns
usage: `grep pattern file options`

e.g. `find . -name \*.txt | grep taxes -i`

### Options
-i = case insensitive
-r = recursive through directories
-v = finds all instances of no pattern match
-w = serches for single word and not just any instance

Examples

To find the pattern 'taxes' recursively
    `$ grep taxes * -ri`
    The star looks at all files in the current directory

To find all occurrences of the word `patricia' in a file:

    $ grep 'patricia' myfile

To find all occurrences of the pattern `.Pp' at the beginning of a line:

    $ grep '^\.Pp' myfile

The apostrophes ensure the entire expression is evaluated by grep instead
of by the user's shell.  The caret \^ matches the null string at the
beginning of a line, and the \\ escapes the '.', which would otherwise
match any character.

To find all lines in a file which do not contain the words `foo' or
`bar':

    $ grep -v -e 'foo' -e 'bar' myfile
