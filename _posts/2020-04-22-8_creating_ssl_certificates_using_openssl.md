## Creating SSL Certificates Using OpenSSL

#### Create a Certificate Authority Private Key and Certificate

First, we'll need a place to store our certificates:
```
mkdir -p /etc/nginx/certificates
```

```
cd /etc/nginx/certificates
```

Generate a private key for the CA:
```
openssl genrsa 2048 > ca-key.pem
```

Generate the X509 certificate for the CA:
```
openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -days 365000 \
      -key ca-key.pem -out ca-cert.pem
```

#### Create a Private Key and a Self-Signed Certificate for the NGINX Server

Generate a private key and create a certificate request for the NGINX server. We will have to answer some questions:

```
openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -days 365000 \
      -nodes -keyout server-key.pem -out server-req.pem
```

Next, process the key to remove the passphrase:
```
openssl rsa -in server-key.pem -out server-key.pem
```
We should see the following: `writing RSA key`
Generate a self-signed X509 certificate for the NGINX server from the certificate request:
```
openssl x509 -req -in server-req.pem -days 365000 \
      -CA ca-cert.pem -CAkey ca-key.pem -set_serial 01 \
      -out server-cert.pem
```

We need to allow the `nginx` user access to the certificates. Add 'read' permissions for 'group' and 'other':
```
chmod 644 *
```
#### Verify the Self-Signed Certificate for the NGINX Server

Let’s verify that the X509 certificate was correctly generated:
```
openssl verify -CAfile ca-cert.pem server-cert.pem
```
We should see the following: `server-cert.pem: OK`
